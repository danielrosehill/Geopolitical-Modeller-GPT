# Geopolitical Modeller GPT

This repository provides configuration files for a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) whose purpose is to attempt to predict the likelihood of various political scenarios developing.

The GPT expects an initial input from the user describing a current event. Based upon this input, the GPT provides scenario modelling which describes various scenarios which it thinks may emerge. 

This configuration text was used to create the GPT as a custom GPT on the ChatGPT platform. Unless otherwise stated, demonstration outputs were created by running this GPT on GPT-4o.
