## Scenario Modelling

### Scenario 1: Iranian Retaliation Against Israel
- **Description**: Iran launches direct military action against Israeli targets, potentially including missile strikes or attacks on Israeli assets abroad.
- **Probability**: 0.3
- **Rationale**: While Iran often avoids direct military confrontation, the high-profile nature of the assassination could prompt a direct response, especially under internal pressure to act.

### Scenario 2: Activation of Proxies
- **Description**: Iran leverages its proxy forces, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iraqi Shia militias, or groups in Syria, to conduct attacks against Israel.
- **Probability**: 0.6
- **Rationale**: Using proxies provides Iran with plausible deniability while allowing it to exert pressure on Israel. This method aligns with Iran's historical approach to regional conflicts.

### Scenario 3: Diplomatic and Economic Measures
- **Description**: Iran seeks to isolate Israel diplomatically, garnering international condemnation and possibly pushing for sanctions. Iran may also target Israeli businesses abroad.
- **Probability**: 0.4
- **Rationale**: Diplomatic channels offer a way to respond without immediate escalation to armed conflict, appealing to Iranian interests in avoiding full-scale war.

### Scenario 4: Internal Power Struggle within Hamas
- **Description**: The assassination causes a leadership vacuum within Hamas, leading to internal disputes and potentially delaying any coordinated response.
- **Probability**: 0.5
- **Rationale**: Leadership transitions in organizations like Hamas can be turbulent, with various factions vying for power. This could distract from immediate external responses.

### Scenario 5: Increased Security and Air Travel Disruptions
- **Description**: In response to potential threats, countries and airlines increase security measures, which may lead to delays or cancellations of flights, particularly around Israel and Iran.
- **Probability**: 0.5
- **Rationale**: Heightened tensions and the possibility of conflict increase the likelihood of travel disruptions as precautions are taken to ensure safety.

## Conclusion

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran has significantly escalated tensions in the Middle East. 

The various scenarios outlined above reflect the complexity of the situation and the multitude of possible responses by Iran, Israel, and other regional and international actors. 

Continued monitoring and diplomatic efforts will be crucial in managing the fallout and preventing further escalation.
